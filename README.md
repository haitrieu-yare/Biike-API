# Biike-API

Capstone  Project - Backend API for Biiké Mobile App and Web Admin

To help modern people change their habits of transportation, Biiké is an Internet-based and 
Smartphone-enable application that will help connect Biker (who offer a free ride) and Keer (who 
seek for a free ride). Unlike the existing systems, people who use Biiké will not have to pay money 
after every trip. On the contrary, through using this app, they earn their points after trips and use 
that point for other services provided by Biiké.
